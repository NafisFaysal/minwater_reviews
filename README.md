## Mineral Water Review Recommendation System

Mineral Water Review Recommendation System you can give a review and get recommendation base on your review and lots of fun.

## What is this repository for?

This is my another pet project. Have no version :p

## Requirements

This was only tested on Linux environments. It might also work on Windows (I am totally noob on windows). Note that most of the system can work with a simpler setup, but don't assume this to be.

## Installation

pretty simple just install [ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) .It already has preinstalled all the package and other requirements stuff.

## Usage
If you installed [ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution package, you can start with: 

$ git clone https://github.com/NafisFaysal/minwater_reviews </br>
