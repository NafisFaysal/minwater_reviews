#What is this repository for?

This is my pet project. 
Have no version :p 

#Requirements

This was only tested on Linux environments. It might also work on Windows (I am noob on windows). Note that most of the system can work with a simpler setup, but don't assume this to be.

#Contributing

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and feel free to submitting pull requests.
